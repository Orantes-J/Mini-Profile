    <p>Hello there, I am a Web-Developer who uses python for data analysis and backend. I have a one year of experience with python, over this time I have realized that there is so much to learn. 
        I took the time to also take some Udemy courses for Python, Javascript, and C++. I know it is important to have an understanding of computer logic rather syntax.I would deem myself to be at a beginners level,
        as I rhink this is the best way to keep learning.I love to learn new things, i try to stay occupied all day with at least learning or even reading a hot topic on 
        techcrunch.com.

                <em>In High School I was not the brightest, I can admit that I was a trouble maker
                    .I personally seeked discipline, I joined <strong>J.R.O.T.C</strong> and only then I became hungry to learn and not waste any time.

                    as it was a solid beginners foundation. I just didn't know how and where to start.I graduated on time and with most of my peers, after graduation I realized it was not enough. I then purchased a udemy course.
